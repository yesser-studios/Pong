This Pong clone has everything you would expect from a Pong clone - two pads and a ball.
Play it with a keyboard or a gamepad with a friend.

This game includes:
- A ball moving around
- Two pads to prevent the ball from getting into your side of the screen, one for each player.

If you're on Mac or Linux, you can open the Pong_LinuxMacDev.slnf solution filter in Rider. ~Sadly, Visual Studio Code doesn't support solution filters at this moment.~ As of [Microsoft/vscode-dotnettools#103](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/103) Visual Studio Code supports solution filters. You can open them using the "*.NET: Open Solution*" command.
